            <p class="img-description">In 1486, Ferdinand of Aragon convened a meeting of counsellors to study Christopher Columbus’ proposal to explore a new maritime route to the Indies. Held at the convent of San Esteban of Salamanca, the result of the meeting is history (though
                the proposal was initially rejected at this meeting).</p>

            <p class="img-description">A 7-year old Mozart met Louis XV in 1763 when his father took him and his sister on a Grand Tour of the royal courts of Europe. Louis XV received Mozart in the company of Mme Pompadour and requested an impromptu organ performance in the Royal
                Chapel. The young musician played one extended note, then another, followed by a flood of harmonious music. The king was astounded. Though Mozart met the young Marie Antoinette in Austria, he never met Louis XVI. When the young Mozart
                was received at Schönbrunn Palace, the magnificent Habsburg summer residence, he played before Holy Roman Emperor Franz Stefan and Empress Maria Theresia, the court composer Georg Christoph Wagenseil, and many of Maria Theresia’s children.
                Marie Antoinette’s love of the harp and spinet were well known—as evidenced in later portraits of her with spinet (Franz Xaver Wagenschon, 1769) and harp (by Jacques Fabien Gautier-Dagoty, 1777) so it is probable she would have observed
                the prodigy from Salzburg with interest … we do know that the reception lasted three hours!</p>
